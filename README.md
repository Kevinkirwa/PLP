1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications systematically and efficiently. It involves applying engineering principles, methods, and techniques to ensure that software products are reliable, maintainable, scalable, and meet the needs of users and stakeholders. Software engineering also encompasses management practices to control costs, timelines, and quality throughout a projectâ€™s lifecycle.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): Introduced control structures, making code more organized and easier to maintain.
Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): Enabled modular, reusable code and more complex systems with languages like C++.
Agile Development (2000s): Shifted focus to iterative development, improving flexibility and response to change

3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis: Define and document software requirements.
Design: Plan architecture, interfaces, and database structures.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Linear, phase-based, ideal for stable requirements. Suitable for regulated or fixed-scope projects.
Agile: Iterative, flexible, suited for changing requirements. Ideal for fast-paced projects needing continuous feedback.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, collaborates on design, and fixes bugs.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software for quality, creates test cases, and reports defects.
Project Manager: Plans and oversees the project, manages resources, and ensures timelines and budget adherence.
